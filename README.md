# Movie Recommendation System

This Movie Recommendation System is built using Python and the MovieLens dataset. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, a popular recommendation technique, to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical movie ratings.

## Overview

The Movie Recommendation System leverages the MovieLens dataset, which contains a vast collection of movie ratings from various users. The system analyzes user behavior and movie similarities to generate accurate and relevant movie recommendations. The model workflow includes data loading, data cleaning and manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), collaborative filtering, and movie recommendations.

## Dataset

The MovieLens dataset consists of two main files:

- `movies.csv`: Contains information about movies, including movie IDs, titles, and genres.
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for different movies, linking each rating to a specific user and movie using their respective IDs.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Movie Recommendation System involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the MovieLens dataset into the system using Python and the pandas library.

2. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Perform necessary data cleaning and manipulation steps to prepare the dataset for analysis. This includes dropping unnecessary columns, merging datasets, and creating a consolidated movie dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Analyze the distribution of rating counts and average ratings through data visualization.

4. **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement item-based collaborative filtering to calculate similarities between movies based on user ratings.

5. **Movie Recommendations**: Develop a function that takes a movie title as input and recommends similar movies based on collaborative filtering.

## Usage

To use the Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip` or `conda`.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `movie_recommendation_system.ipynb` to execute the model.

4. Follow the instructions within the Notebook to explore the dataset, generate movie recommendations, and customize the system as per your needs.

## Dependencies
